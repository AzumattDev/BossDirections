| 1.0.4     | - Add configurations for seeing distance to boss in messages, and toggling adding a pin to the map. Both are default to off. These configs aren't synced with the server if installed there. - Requested by Majestic as an update to the mod. |
| 1.0.3     | - Undeprecate at request of Majestic. Add ServerSync and offerings to fireplaces to point in the direction of a boss. Uses the `Azumatt.BossDirections.Offerings.yml` file that generates on first mod load to dictate this.                  |
